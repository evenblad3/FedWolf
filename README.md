# FedWolf

Correction
Code for paper - **[Dynamic Adaptive Federated Learning on Local Long-Tailed Data]**

## Prerequisite

NVIDIA 4090

NVIDIA Driver 520.56.06

python 3.8.0

CUDA 11.8

torch 2.0.1

## Datasets
CIFAR10/100

ImageNet1000

CIFAR is easyï¼Œit will be downloaded automatically to `/Folder/Data/Raw/`

[ImageNet1000 (ILSVRC2012)](https://image-net.org/challenges/LSVRC/2012/index.php) needs be downloaded and put all files to `/Folder/Data/Raw/`

Make sure `PATH` in `options.py` is right.

Then, you can follow the following steps to run the experiments:
```bash
python fedwolf.py
```

Results in ./Results
